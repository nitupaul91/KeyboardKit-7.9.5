## About KeyboardKit

KeyboardKit helps you create custom keyboards for iOS and iPadOS, using Swift and SwiftUI. It extends Apple's native keyboard APIs and provides you with more functionality.

KeyboardKit lets you create keyboards that mimic the native iOS keyboards in a few lines of code. These keyboards can be customized to change input keys, layout, design, behavior etc.

</p>

KeyboardKit also lets you use completely custom views together with the features that the library provides. Most of the library can be used on all major Apple platforms.

KeyboardKit supports `iOS 14`, `macOS 11`, `tvOS 14` and `watchOS 7`, although some features are unavailable on some platforms.



## Installation

KeyboardKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit.git
```

You can add the library to the main app, the keyboard extension and any other targets that need it. If you prefer to not have external dependencies, you can also just copy the source code into your app.



## Supported Locales

KeyboardKit is localized in [60+ keyboard-specific locales][Localization]:

🇦🇱 🇦🇪 🇦🇲 🇧🇾 🇧🇬 🇦🇩 🏳️ 🇭🇷 🇨🇿 🇩🇰 <br />
🇳🇱 🇧🇪 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇺🇸 🇪🇪 🇫🇴 🇵🇭 🇫🇮 🇫🇷 <br />

## Getting Started

The online documentation has a [getting-started guide][Getting-Started] that helps you get started.

After installing KeyboardKit, just `import KeyboardKit` and make your `KeyboardViewController` inherit ``KeyboardInputViewController`` instead of `UIInputViewController`:

```swift
import KeyboardKit

class KeyboardController: KeyboardInputViewController {}
```

This gives your controller access to additional functionality, such as new lifecycle functions like `viewWillSetupKeyboard()`, observable state like `keyboardContext`, services like `keyboardActionHandler` and much more.

The default ``KeyboardInputViewController`` behavior is to setup an English `SystemKeyboard`. It will then call `viewWillSetupKeyboard()` when the keyboard view should be created or updated. 

To set up KeyboardKit with a custom view, you can override `viewWillSetupKeyboard()` and call `.setup(with:)` to customize the `SystemKeyboard` or use a custom view:

```swift
class KeyboardViewController: KeyboardInputViewController {

    func viewWillSetupKeyboard() {
        super.viewWillSetupKeyboard()
        setup { controller in
            VStack(spacing: 0) {
                MyCustomToolbar()
                SystemKeyboard(
                    controller: controller,
                    autocompleteToolbar: .none
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The view builder provides an unowned controller reference to avoid reference cycles and memory leaks.

For more information, please see the [online documentation][Documentation] and [getting-started guide][Getting-Started].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] has articles, code examples etc. that let you overview the various parts of the library and understand how they all connect to each other.

The online documentation is currently iOS-specific. To generate documentation for the other platforms, open the package in Xcode, select a simulator then run `Product/Build Documentation`.



## KeyboardKit Pro

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] extends KeyboardKit with pro features, such as localized keyboards and services, autocomplete, dictation, emoji skintones, additional views etc. It lets you create fully localized keyboards with a single line of code.



## App Store Application

If you want to try out KeyboardKit without having to write any code, there is a [KeyboardKit app][app-store] in the App Store, that lets you try out KeyboardKit and many of its features.

The App Store app uses [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] to provide support for 60+ locales, autocomplete, dictation, emoji skintones etc. 



## Demo Application

This project has a demo app that lets you try out KeyboardKit and KeyboardKit Pro.

* The main app shows how to display keyboard state, link to system settings, etc.
* The `English` keyboard uses KeyboardKit and a `SystemKeyboard` with a standard, English locale.
* The `Unicode` keyboard uses KeyboardKit and a `SystemKeyboard` with unicode-based input keys.
* The `Custom` keyboard uses KeyboardKit and a `SystemKeyboard` with custom keys, layouts and styles.
* The `Pro` keyboard uses KeyboardKit Pro and a `SystemKeyboard` with all LRT locales, autocomplete etc.

Just open and run the demo app in the `Demo` folder, then enable the keyboards you want to try under System Settings. Note that you need to enable full access to try some features, like audio and haptic feedback.



## Support

KeyboardKit is open-source and completely free, but you can sponsor this project on [GitHub Sponsors][Sponsors], upgrade to [KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] or [get in touch][Email] for freelance work, paid support etc.
