     This config is used to show how dictation can be set up
     for an app and its keyboard.

     > Note: Your app will most likely be able to share this
     config between the app and the keyboard. This demo must
     however use two configs, since the app uses KeyboardKit
     and the keyboard uses KeyboardKit Pro.

     > Important: This is only for instruction purposes. The
     required app group is NOT configured for the demo since
     it must be signed. You will still be able to initialize
     dictation from the demo keyboard, but the keyboard will
     not be able to read the dictated text.
