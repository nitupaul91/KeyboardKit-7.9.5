/**
 This controller registers a Keyboard Pro license that has a
 large set of locales and pro features, like autocomplete.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.

 `IMPORTANT!` You may have noticed how the demo project only
 links KeyboardKit Pro to the app target, while it links the
 KeyboardKit base library to every target that uses it. This
 is because KeyboardKit Pro is a binary framework, which has
 to be linked in this way.
