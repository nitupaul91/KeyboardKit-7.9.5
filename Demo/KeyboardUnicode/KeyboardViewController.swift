/**
 This keyboard demonstrates how to create a keyboard using a
 unicode-based input set.

 This keyboard does not override `viewWillSetupKeyboard` and
 therefore uses a standard `SystemKeyboard`. It however uses
 ``DemoLayoutProvider`` to get a custom keyboard layout.

 To use this keyboard, you must enable it in system settings
 ("Settings/General/Keyboards"). It needs full access to get
 access to features like haptic feedback.
