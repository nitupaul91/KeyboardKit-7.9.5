/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to give autocomplete suggestions as the user types.

 Simply call ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:completion:)`` to
 get autocomplete suggestions based on the provided text.

 KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard provider as it does for
 other services. You must either implement a custom provider
 or use KeyboardKit Pro.
 
 KeyboardKit Pro unlocks two autocomplete providers when you
 register your license key. `LocalAutocompleteProvider` runs
 locally on the device and supports most ``KeyboardLocale``s,
 while `RemoteAutocompleteProvider` can be configured to use
 any remote autocomplete API.
