/**
 This class can be used to observe the enabled state of your
 keyboard extension.

 This type lets you check if a keyboard extension is enabled
 in System Settings, if it's currently active and if the app
 has been given full access.

 This type supports bundle id wildcards, which means that it
 can inspect the state of multiple keyboard extensions:

 ```
 let state = KeyboardEnabledContext(bundleId: "com.myapp.*")
 ```

 This context is not added to your keyboard input controller,
 since its intended to be used in the main app, where it can
 be used to display the keyboard extension state.

     the main application.

       - bundleId: The bundle ID of the keyboard extension.
       - notificationCenter: The notification center to use to observe changes.
