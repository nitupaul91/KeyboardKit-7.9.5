/**
 This protocol can be implemented by any classes that can be
 used to generate a ``KeyboardLayout`` for a certain context.
 
 KeyboardKit will create a ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider``
 instance when the keyboard extension is started, then apply
 it to ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardLayoutProvider``.
 This instance is then used by default to create layouts for
 your keyboard when you use a standard ``SystemKeyboard``.
 
 To change the layouts that are used for different keyboards,
 such as alphabetic, numeric and symbolic, you can implement
 a custom provider.
 
 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 implement it from scratch or inherit the standard class and
 override the parts that you want to change. When the custom
 implementation is done, you can just replace the controller
 service to make KeyboardKit use the custom service globally.
 
 KeyboardKit Pro can be used to unlock a unique provider for
 every ``KeyboardLocale``.
